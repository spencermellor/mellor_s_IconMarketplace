# Spencer Mellor's Icon Marketplace!

## Requirements:

Build a branded, scalable themed icon set using Adobe Illustrator. Export each icon from
Illustrator as an SVG.

Add some simple interactivity with JavaScript. Use HTML (and the appropriate elements) to
include a description of the icon set.

Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a
minimum of 10 SVG icons in Illustrator - the theme is up to you. Use CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page with some branding and a (very) brief description for each. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag source, as an SVG tag, or using the object tag. Use CSS interactions transitions to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example, reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc). When clicked, toggle a “selected” CSS class on the active icon and log a message to the console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed
with a JavaScript string template and variable
